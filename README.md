# 🌟 Task-01: Visualizing Population Insights 🧩📊

## 🚀 Overview  
**"Numbers whisper secrets, and this project is their voice."**  
This task explores the World Bank's population dataset, transforming raw data into visual stories. Using the interactive power of **Jupyter Notebook** and **Plotly**, I’ve created dynamic visualizations to uncover trends and patterns in global population data.

## 🔍 What’s Inside?  
- An interactive **Jupyter Notebook** that processes population data and showcases visualizations step by step.  
- A **bar graph** that displays the top 30 countries with the highest mean population (from 1965 to 2023), arranged in descending order.  
- Clean and structured cells for better readability and reproducibility.  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓 for interactive development.  
- **Python** 🐍 for data processing.  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and calculating mean population.  
- **Plotly** for creating interactive and visually engaging bar charts.  

## 🌟 Key Highlights  
- Calculated the **mean population** for each country from 1965 to 2023.  
- Arranged the countries by their mean population in descending order.  
- Plotted the **top 30 countries** with the highest mean population using **Plotly** for an interactive and dynamic visualization.  
- Insightful trends that help identify countries with consistently high populations over the years.
